// Package duplex is the seam beneath every protocol Nighthall carries: a
// frames duplex connection. It is ordered, message-framed, bidirectional and
// closed explicitly with a code and a reason, and it is nothing else — no
// JSON, no requests, no correlation, no events, no reconnection. The
// nighthall.duplex/1 profile runs over it, and so does an agent's own
// protocol relayed verbatim; beneath it the transport is a WebSocket today
// and may be something else tomorrow, and neither side of the seam knows
// which.
//
// Framing is the transport's: a WebSocket has message boundaries of its own,
// a byte stream would need a framing of its own, and either way a frame
// arrives whole or not at all. Close semantics travel: the codes are the
// WebSocket registry's numbers on every transport, so that a policy
// violation or an oversized frame is refused the same way everywhere.
