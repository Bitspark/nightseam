/**
 * The suite every transport of the seam is held to in TypeScript: what a
 * `FrameConnection` promises and nothing of the transport that keeps it, so
 * that a peer written against the seam can trust the same things wherever it
 * runs — frames arrive in order and whole, in either direction, every
 * listener is given every one of them and detaching one leaves the others,
 * a close carries its code and its reason to both sides and refuses what is
 * sent after it, and `buffered` counts what a send left with the transport
 * and nothing once the transport has taken it.
 *
 * It is the twin of `duplex/go/duplextest` and holds the seam as this
 * language has it, which is not in every respect as Go has it. Two of the Go
 * suite's promises are therefore not asked for here. A receive limit is not
 * the seam's: a connection takes none, and an oversized frame is refused by
 * the peer and by the tunnel, each with 1009 and each held to it by its own
 * tests. An abort is not the seam's either — the Go `Conn` has one and a
 * `FrameConnection` has not, a close being how a connection ends here. Nor
 * is the order of a last frame against the close behind it: a transport may
 * deliver the close first, so a peer that needs a frame seen sends it and
 * waits rather than closing on top of it.
 *
 * The Go suite's remaining promise, that a send waits while the receiver does
 * not receive, is asked here of every transport that holds anything at all:
 * `send` cannot wait in this language, so what a transport cannot hand on it
 * holds, and `buffered` counts it until the far end takes it — the pipe past
 * its bound, a channel past the other side's window. A transport that hands
 * every frame to something else inside the send holds nothing and reads zero
 * throughout; it says so with `holds: false` and the case then asks it only
 * what it can keep.
 *
 * A transport's own test calls `run` with a name and a way to make a
 * connected pair: `duplex/ts` runs it over the in-memory pipe and over the
 * WebSocket adapter, `tunnel/ts` over a channel, as the three Go packages
 * run the Go suite.
